Tools to send test traces/logs/metrics

## Proto definitions

Proto definitions for the OpenTelemetry collector have been downloaded from `https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto`.

## Dev notes

- `https://ghz.sh/` is a load testing tool for gRPC (tried but fiddly as per quick tests)
